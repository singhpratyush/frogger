## Gameplay

The gameplay is simple. You cross the path to advance levels.
With each level, the game keeps becoming more and more difficult.
Initially, up to 5 levels, the number of enemies increase and then the speed at which they move increases.


## How to run the game?

Just open the [`index.html`](index.html) file in a `HTML5` enabled browser.
